Rotary encoder DT bindings

Required properties:
- gpios: a spec for at least two GPIOs to be used, most significant first

Optional properties:
- linux,axis: the input subsystem axis to map to this rotary encoder.
  Defaults to 0 (ABS_X / REL_X)
- rotary-encoder,noaxis: Report e.g. key events instead of axis events.
  Event codes must be specified by code-cw and code-ccw and the event
  type by linux,event-type.
- rotary-encoder,steps: Number of steps in a full turnaround of the
  encoder. Only relevant for absolute axis. Defaults to 24 which is a
  typical value for such devices.
- rotary-encoder,relative-axis: register a relative axis rather than an
  absolute one. Relative axis will only generate +1/-1 events on the input
  device, hence no steps need to be passed.
- rotary-encoder,rollover: Automatic rollover when the rotary value becomes
  greater than the specified steps or smaller than 0. For absolute axis only.
- rotary-encoder,steps-per-period: Number of steps (stable states) per period.
  The values have the following meaning:
  1: Full-period mode (default)
  2: Half-period mode
  4: Quarter-period mode
- wakeup-source: Boolean, rotary encoder can wake up the system.
- rotary-encoder,encoding: String, the method used to encode steps.
  Supported are "gray" (the default and more common) and "binary".
- linux,code-cw: Event code emitted for every step clockwise.
- linux,code-ccw: Event code emitted on counter clockwise rotation per step.
- linux,event-type: Event type for code-cw and code-ccw.
  Defaults to (KEY_EV)

Deprecated properties:
- rotary-encoder,half-period: Makes the driver work on half-period mode.
  This property is deprecated. Instead, a 'steps-per-period ' value should
  be used, such as "rotary-encoder,steps-per-period = <2>".

Example:

		rotary@0 {
			compatible = "rotary-encoder";
			gpios = <&gpio 19 1>, <&gpio 20 0>; /* GPIO19 is inverted */
			linux,axis = <0>; /* REL_X */
			rotary-encoder,encoding = "gray";
			rotary-encoder,relative-axis;
		};

		rotary@1 {
			compatible = "rotary-encoder";
			gpios = <&gpio 21 0>, <&gpio 22 0>;
			linux,axis = <1>; /* ABS_Y */
			rotary-encoder,steps = <24>;
			rotary-encoder,encoding = "binary";
			rotary-encoder,rollover;
		};

		rotary@2 {
			compatible = "rotary-encoder";
			gpios = <&gpio5 30 0>, <&gpio5 31 0>;
			rotary-encoder,noaxis;
			linux,code-cw = <103>; /* DOWN */
			linux,code-ccw = <108>; /* UP */
			linux,event-type = <KEY_EV>;
		};
